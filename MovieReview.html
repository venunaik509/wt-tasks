    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The British Secret Agent, starring <b>Nandamuri Kalyan Ram</b>, it becomes clear that it is of utmost importance that we acknowledge the displeasing controversy that has arisen over the directorâ€™s credit. For the unversed, Devil has released with co-producer Abhishek Nama officially named as the director, after which, Naveen Medaram, who was initially credited as the director, alleged that the film is entirely his creation and that he was denied the recognition. The film is evidently a mammoth of an effort from the makers and that only makes the controversy even more disturbing.
